Graphical illustration of DyEPAD. (a) DyEPAD utilizes GCN layers to derive node embeddings from graph-structured EHR data, and subsequently employs GRU layers to capture evolutionary patterns. (b) The derived embeddings are then processed through tensor algebraic operations for frequency domain analysis, capturing the complete range of evolutionary patterns.
